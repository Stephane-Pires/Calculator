First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### Stack :

-   NextJS, ChakraUI, React, Prettier, TrivagoSortImport
-   NextJS : Used "only" to start an "Typescript-App" with "Fast-Reloading" & "Routing"
-   React : Use as a Frontend Tool
-   ChakraUI : Used as a Component Library Toolbox (also handle the Theme)
-   Prettier : Because you can't work without it
-   TrivagoSortImport : Because i have been traumatised with "Import sort order" at AnalogWay

### Features :

-   Calculate an operation or a list of operations.
-   Handle click inside the client UI or on the Keyboard
